## 🧩 Overview

**NTT DATA – Jira Quick Finder** is a lightweight browser extension (for **Chrome** and **Edge**) designed to **instantly open Jira issues across multiple Jira instances** using a simple key like `MAG-6660`.

It helps teams working with several Jira servers (clients, environments, or projects) jump directly to the right issue — without needing to remember multiple URLs or logins.

---

## 🚀 Features (v1.0.3)

### 🔍 Fast Issue Lookup
- Enter any Jira issue key (e.g., `MAG-6660`) to open it instantly.
- Supports **multiple keys separated by commas** → opens all in new tabs.  
  Example: `MAG-6660,MAG-6661`

### ⚙️ Configurable Jira Instances
- In the **Options page**, define multiple **prefix → base URL** pairs.  
  Example:  
  - `MAG` → `https://portail.agir.client.com/browse/`
  - `ABC` → `https://mycompanyjira.atlassian.net/browse/`
- Add unlimited Jira configurations.
- Data is safely stored using Chrome’s `sync` storage (shared across your signed-in browsers).

### 🧠 Smart Key Mapping
- Automatically detects the **prefix before the dash** (`-`) to match the correct Jira URL.
- Example: `MAG-1234` opens the Jira configured for `MAG`.

### ⚡ Keyboard Shortcuts
Two productivity boosters are built-in:
- **Alt + J** → Open the extension popup.
- **Alt + Shift + J** → Instantly open issues from the clipboard text.

> Example: copy “MAG-9999” and press **Alt+Shift+J** → the issue opens directly!

### 🧰 Clean & Responsive UI
- Modern NTT DATA look with dark text and clean layout.
- Buttons with icons for quick recognition:
  - ➕ **Add**
  - 💾 **Save**
  - ❌ **Close Tab**

### 🪟 Popup Convenience
- Accessed from the NTT DATA icon in the browser toolbar.
- Input field auto-focused on open.
- Press **Enter** to trigger search (same as clicking “Send”).
- Includes quick access to the configuration page.
